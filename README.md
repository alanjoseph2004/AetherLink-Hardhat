üåê AetherLink

AetherLink is a decentralized blockchain-based product registration and bidding platform. It ensures product authenticity and transparency by enabling secure product registration, ownership verification, and transparent bidding ‚Äî all powered by smart contracts.
Features

    Product Registration:
    Users can register products securely with unique metadata stored on the blockchain.

    Bidding Mechanism:
    Verified users can bid on registered products through an open and fair bidding system.

    Smart Contracts:
    Core functionalities are handled through Solidity smart contracts, ensuring transparency and automation.

    Decentralized Ownership:
    Each product is uniquely associated with an owner, and ownership transfers are immutable.

    Tamper-Proof Logs:
    All transactions and bids are recorded on the blockchain, making them transparent and auditable.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    Node.js and npm

    Truffle Suite or Hardhat

    Ganache (for local testing)

    MetaMask (for interacting with contracts)

    Solidity ^0.8.0

Installation

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AetherLink.git
cd AetherLink
npm install

Compile Contracts

truffle compile

Migrate Contracts

truffle migrate --network development

Run Frontend (if applicable)

npm start

Smart Contracts
ProductRegistration.sol

Handles:

    Product creation

    Ownership assignment

    Duplicate prevention

Bidding.sol

Handles:

    Placing bids

    Selecting highest bidder

    Ownership transfer upon bid acceptance

Security

    Uses OpenZeppelin libraries for secure smart contract patterns.

    Proper access control and input validations in place.

    Followed OWASP and Solidity security best practices.

Technologies Used

    Solidity ‚Äî for writing smart contracts

    Truffle/Ganache ‚Äî for local blockchain testing

    Web3.js / Ethers.js ‚Äî for contract interaction

    React (if frontend used)

    IPFS/Filecoin (optional for decentralized storage of product metadata)

Future Scope

    NFT integration for unique product ownership

    Integration with decentralized identity (DID)

    Full-fledged marketplace UI

    Layer-2 scaling for cost-effective transactions

Testing

Run the test suite:

truffle test

Tests include:

    Product registration and duplication

    Valid and invalid bid scenarios

    Ownership transfer on bid acceptance
